##About

Reflectionfall is a platformer created by Glynn Taylor, where players can shoot up to 3 bouncy lasers. If their own laser hits them they will pick it up, if someone elses does they will die. The game is controller only at the moment. It is inspired by Towerfall's laser arrows and was created for the WGD 2 week "reflection" compo.
